#### Revised front page

The Dependable Systems Group (DSG) is a diverse collection of
colleagues working in a range of areas covering foundations,
technologies and applications of computer science.

The research aims and objectives of the Dependable Systems Group are
to improve the reliability and predictability of computer systems
through the development and application of rigorous design,
implementation and verification techniques. More broadly, Dependable
Systems research is considered as spanning the following three layers:

- Foundations: logic; discrete mathematics; computability; algorithmic analysis and complexity.  
- Technologies: specification oriented prototyping; performance modeling; simulation;
   formal verification; empirical verification and validation; automated reasoning; refinement and synthesis.  
- Applications: safety critical system; secure systems; fault tolerant systems;
   performance optimisation; multi process/processor systems; hybrid/embedded systems; predictable systems.  

We are part of the [Scottish Informatics and Computer Science Alliance
(SICSA)](https://www.sicsa.ac.uk/), which pools together the top computing departments in
Scotland and also provides an enriched research environment for all
staff and students.

We are part of the emerging Scottish Programming Languages Institute (SPLI).

We have strong links to other Scottish universities and these are
listed in the section on Collaborators.

The seminars of the DSG group are merged with those of the LAIV group and a [seminar schedule is available here](https://laiv.uk/laiv-seminars/).

### Notes and Drafts


#### James' text

We are a diverse collection of colleagues working in the related areas
of programing language theory and practice, formal methods and formal
modelling, verification and model checking, interactive theorem
proving [insert more as appropriate], united by the aim of developing
sound, robust methods for the design and implementation of software
systems.

Taken out some sub-items:
- probability and statistics;  -> /something related to ML instead?/
- transformation; -> /droped/
- disaster analysis and recovery; -> /droped; we don't rely have a track record there (?)/

The research aims and objectives of the Dependable Systems Group are
to improve the reliability and predictability of computer systems
through the development and application of rigorous design,
implementation and verification techniques. More broadly, Dependable
Systems research is considered as spanning the following three layers:

- Foundations: discrete mathematics; logic; computability; probability
   and statistics; algorithmic analysis and complexity.  
- Technologies: specification oriented prototyping; performance modeling; simulation;
   formal verification; empirical verification and validation; automated
   reasoning; transformation; refinement and synthesis.  
- Applications:safety critical system; secure systems; fault tolerant systems;
   disaster analysis and recovery; performance optimisation; multi
   process/processor systems; hybrid/embedded systems; predictable
   systems.  

Our current strengths lie mainly within Foundations – models
and formalisms for languages and systems – and within Technologies –
functional programming, performance modelling, parallel prototyping,
automated reasoning and formal verification.

We are part of the Scottish Informatics and Computer Science Alliance
(SICSA), which pools together the top computing departments in
Scotland and also provides an enriched research environment for all
staff and students.

We have strong links to other Scottish universities, in particular
with the Glasgow Parallelism Group at the University of Glasgow on
high-level languages and systems for parallel computation.
